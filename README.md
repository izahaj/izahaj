 Sudi Jahazi – Cybersecurity & Applied Computer Technology Student

I am an undergraduate student at United States International University (USIU) pursuing a degree in Applied Computer Technology with a focus on Cybersecurity and a minor in Psychology. I am interested in how technology and human behavior intersect, especially in areas such as social engineering, user awareness, and human-centered security.

This repository serves as my learning portfolio where I document projects, skills, and progress as I build practical experience in cybersecurity and software development.

## About Me
I am building a strong foundation in programming, cloud computing, and secure systems through coursework and self-learning.  
My interest in psychology helps me understand how human behavior contributes to security risks, which I believe is essential in modern cybersecurity.

I am currently seeking opportunities for internships, industrial attachment, and mentorship.
